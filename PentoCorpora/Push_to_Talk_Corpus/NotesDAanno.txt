Comments from Janine about the transfer of 
============================
DA annotation to new transcripts
============================

- file: FTT_2006-02-13pair1

utt.5 is splitted in two parts in old annotation: present description of piece and coordinate task!
I chose "coordinate task".
 
utt 8/9 are splitted in the new annotation in two utterances. Gave them both the same annotation("feedback_pos", as in old annotation)
 
utt 13-17: some "hm" and "also..." have been rearranged in new annotation (referred to in brackets):
 
old: 
      1:  <utt> [x1][y1]
      2:  [x2][y2]
 

new:  1: <utt>
      2: [x2]
      2: [y2]
      1: [x1]
      1: [y1]
 
I gave each of them the annotation they had in the old structure except
from [x2], which is "Ja?" and in my opinion is an "ask_confirmation".
 

utt. 25/26: splitted in new annotation. I gave them both the same annotation.  
 
utt. 28: old version:
                       1: "Like a Z, okay" --> feedback_pos
         new version: 
                       1: "Like a Z" --> I chose "present description"
                       1: "okay"     --> I chose "feedback_pos"
 

utt. 55/56: new version:  1: "uhm..."
                                   1: "Put it like this..."
 
                old version:  1: "uhm...put it like this..."
 
I gave them the same annotation: describe_position (as in old annotation)
 

utt. 520 was splitted up in the old version. I chose "coordinate_task", because it is the beginning of a new move. Unfortunately, several information is included in the utterance (where to put the piece, how it looks).
